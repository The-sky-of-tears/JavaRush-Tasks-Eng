# Java Tasks

This repository contains Java tasks that I completed during the JavaRush course ([CodeGym](https://codegym.cc/quests) - English version) to learn Java basics.

So, now it contains 3 sections:

1. Java Syntax (classes, objects, methods and variables, the main data types, arrays, conditional statements and loops. Peek at collections and basics of OOP)
2. Java Core (The basics of OOP, streams, serialization, method overloading, interfaces and multiple inheritance. Implemented some design patterns such as Singletone, Adapter and Decorator)
3. Games (in order to test my skills I've implemented game "Space Invaders" using simplified graphics library provided by CodeGym that based on Swing and AWT)
